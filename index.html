<h2>A brief summary of Savitribai Phule's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 at the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra.
    Her birthplace is about fifteen km (9.3 mi) from Shirval and about 50 km (31 mi) from Pune.
    Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of whom belonged to the Mali Community.
    She had three siblings.Savitribai married her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 (he was 13). Though they had no children of their own.
    It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.
    It is said that Yashwant was unable to get married because he was born to a widow, and community beliefs disallowed marriage of "such people".
    Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February of 1889.
</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>
    Savitribai was illiterate at the time of her marriage. Jyotirao educated Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar, his cousin sister at their home along with working at their farm.
    Once she completed her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.
    She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs; the first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar, and the second course was at a Normal School in Poona (Now Pune).
    Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.
</p>
<h3>Career</h3>
<p>
    After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at Poona. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar, sister of Jyotiba Phule who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.
    Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide-wada. Bhidewada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing.
    The curriculum at Bhidewada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies.
    By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had approximately one hundred and fifty students enrolled.
    Like the curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the three schools differed from those used in government schools. The author Divya Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were regarded as being superior to those used by government schools.
    As a result of this reputation, the number of girls receiving their education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government schools.
    Unfortunately, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success came with much resistance from the local community with conservative views. Kandukuri states that Savitribai often travelled to her school carrying an extra sari because she would be assailed by her conservative opposition with stones, dung, and verbal abuse.
    Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at Jyotirao's father's home.
    However, in 1839, Jyotirao's father asked the couple to leave his home because their work was considered a sin as per the Manusmriti and its derived Brahmanical texts.

<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>
    Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own.
    It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this.
    It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow.
    Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February 1889.
</p>
<h3>Assasination</h3>
<p>
    Savitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic to treat those affected by the worldwide Third Pandemic of the bubonic plague when it appeared in the area around Nalasopara in 1897.
    The clinic was established at stern outskirts of Pune, in an area free of infection. Savitribai died a heroic death trying to save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad.
    Upon learning that Gaekwad's son had contracted the Plague in the Mahar settlement outside of Mundhwa, Savitribai Phule rushed to his side and carried him on her back to the hospital.
    In the process, Savitribai Phule caught the Plague and died at 9:00pm on 10 March 1897.
</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>
    Savitribai Phule's legacy lives on today, her work for Girl's- women's education are hugely respected.
    Along with B. R. Ambedkar and Annabhau Sathe, Phule has become an icon in particular for the backward classes. Women in local branches of the Manavi Hakk Abhiyan (Human Rights Campaign, a Mang-Ambedkarite body) frequently organise processions on their jayanti (birthday in Marathi and other Indian languages).
    Pune City Corporation created a memorial for her in 1983.
    On 10 March 1998 a stamp was released by India Post in honour of Phule.
    Savitribai's birthdate, 3 January, is celebrated as Balika Din (lit. 'Girl child day') in the whole of Maharashtra, especially in girls' schools.
    In 2015, the University of Pune was renamed as Savitribai Phule Pune University in her honour.
    On 3 January 2017, the search engine Google marked the 186th anniversary of the birth of Savitribai Phule with a Google doodle.
